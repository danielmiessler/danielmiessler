### Hi, I'm Daniel Miessler

I build open-source tools that help humans get more from AI.

Currently working on [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric), [Telos](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos), and [PAI](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI).

I also write about AI and security at [danielmiessler.com](https://danielmiessler.com) and run the [Unsupervised Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/subscribe) newsletter.
