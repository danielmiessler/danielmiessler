### Hi, I'm Daniel Miessler

I build open-source infrastructure for upgrading humans with AI.

## The Vision: [Human 3.0](https://human3.ai)

I believe we're at an inflection point where AI can genuinely augment human capability—not replace us, but make us better versions of ourselves. My projects are all pieces of this puzzle:

**[TELOS](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos)** is a framework for articulating who you are, what you value, and what you're trying to achieve—structured data that AI can actually use to help you.

**[Substrate](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Substrate)** is the philosophical foundation—a framework for understanding what humans are, what we want, and what progress actually means.

**[PAI](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI)** is Personal AI Infrastructure—the scaffolding for building your own AI assistant that knows your context, follows your preferences, and improves over time. It's what I use daily to run my own AI system.

**[Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)** is a collection of crowdsourced prompts for common AI tasks—extract wisdom, analyze security, summarize content, and more.

Together: **TELOS** (who you are) → **Substrate** (worldview) → **PAI** (infrastructure) → **Fabric** (prompts)
