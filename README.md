### Hi, I'm Daniel Miessler

I'm worried about humanity's future.

Most people built their identities around their jobs—their title, their place in a hierarchy, their usefulness to an organization. AI is about to automate a lot of that, which will cause a crisis for millions.

But I think this is also an opportunity. If we do it right, AI can free people to discover who they actually are—their purposes, their gifts, the things they'd pursue even if nobody paid them.

That's what I'm working on: helping humans upgrade themselves for a post-work world.

## What I'm Building

**[TELOS](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos)** helps you articulate who you are, what you value, and what you're trying to achieve—structured self-knowledge that AI can actually use to help you.

**[PAI](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI)** is Personal AI Infrastructure—the scaffolding for building your own AI assistant that knows your context, follows your preferences, and improves over time.

**[Substrate](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Substrate)** is the deeper foundation—a framework for understanding what humans are, what we want, and what progress actually means.

**[Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)** is a collection of crowdsourced prompts for common AI tasks—extract wisdom, analyze security, summarize content, and more.

**[Human 3.0](https://human3.ai)** is the philosophy—a framework for human flourishing when AI handles the routine work.
