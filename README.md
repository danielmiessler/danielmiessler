### Hi, I'm Daniel Miessler

I build open-source infrastructure for upgrading humans with AI.

## The Vision: Human 3.0

I believe we're at an inflection point where AI can genuinely augment human capability—not replace us, but make us better versions of ourselves. My projects are all pieces of this puzzle:

**[Substrate](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Substrate)** is the philosophical foundation—a framework for understanding what humans are, what we want, and what progress actually means. It's about building a coherent worldview before building technology.

**[TELOS](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos)** turns that philosophy into personal context. It's a framework for articulating who you are, what you value, and what you're trying to achieve—structured data that AI can actually use to help you.

**[PAI](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI)** is Personal AI Infrastructure—the scaffolding for building your own AI assistant that knows your context, follows your preferences, and improves over time. It's what I use daily to run my own AI system.

**[Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)** is the capability layer—250+ modular prompts that can be combined into pipelines. Extract wisdom from content, analyze security, generate ideas, and more.

Together: **Substrate** (why) → **TELOS** (who you are) → **PAI** (how it runs) → **Fabric** (what it can do)
